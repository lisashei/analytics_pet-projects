# Company Performance

## Description
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides insights into company performance across key metrics: gross profit, sales, and quantity. It enables filtering by year and metric and includes visualizations such as performance indicators, a treemap, a waterfall chart, a line and stacked column chart, and a scatter plot.

## Main Goals
- Present a summary of selected metrics: Year-to-date (YTD) value, Previous year value (PYTD), the difference between YTD and PYTD, and Gross profit percentage.
- Identify the bottom-10 performing countries compared to the previous year.
- Compare metric performance across months, countries, and products between the current and previous year.
- Track product type performance by month and compare it to the previous year.
- Segment clients based on profitability and the selected metrics.

## Tools Used
- Power BI

## Results Interpretation
Several key insights:
- Compared to 2023, gross profit declined by $77.62K in 2024, sales decreased by $135.89K, and the quantity sold dropped by 12.37K units.
- Canada is the lowest-performing country in 2024 across all metrics (gross profit, sales, quantity). Other bottom countries include Germany and Japan for gross profit, Colombia and Croatia for sales, and the USA and Hungary for quantity. The company needs to adjust its regional strategies for these markets to improve performance.
- March and April 2024 saw significant declines in all metrics compared to the previous year. In March, the gross profit decline was driven by Poland and Germany (indoor and outdoor products). In April, the decline was driven by Canada (all product types). Conversely, February 2024 was a high-performing month, especially in China and Brazil.
- Clients with high profitability and sales should be protected and offered high service. Clients with high profitability and low sales have a great potential and the company needs to focus on strategies to increase sales volume among them. Clients with high sales and low profitability need to be analysed to understand causes of low profitability (e.g. excessive discounts, high logistics costs, low-margin products) and adjust strategies accordingly. For low sales and profitability clients the company needs to evaluate their growth potential and cost efficiency, and if potential exists, these clients need to be incentivized with targeted campaigns or special offers. 
- Clients with high profitability and low quantity can have great potential and need to be marketed to effectively to increase volume. High quantity and low profitability clients need optimization in costs and prices to improve profit.

## Future Use
This dashboard is a vital tool for monitoring performance trends and identifying regional and product-level opportunities and risks. It can inform decisions for adjusting regional business strategies and improving sales, marketing, operational planning, and product management.
