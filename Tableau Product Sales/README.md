# Product Sales Analysis

## Description
This interactive dashboard analyzes product sales performance to identify key trends and drivers. It features filters for year and category, along with visualizations including key performance indicators, a bar chart, bullet graph, scatter plot, and Pareto chart.

## Main Goals
The primary objectives of this dashboard are to:
- Present a summary of key metrics (total sales, profit, quantity sold and number of orders).
- Show subcategory performance in sales and number of orders, as well as contribution to total profit.
- Track monthly profit performance against KPI targets (profit same month previous year + 20%).
- Visualize product segmentation by sales and quantity sold.
- Visualize ABC analysis of products.

## Tools Used
- Tableau

## Results Interpretation
Several key insights were revealed:
- The Tech category is the company's sales leader. Within it, Laptops are the top subcategory, constituting 33% of all profit.
- Headwear leads in number of orders, and after the Tech subcategories, it performs best in sales, while Bags and Shirts underperform in both sales and number of orders.
- 2023 was the most profitable year, where every month greatly surpassed KPI targets, while 2022 failed to meet them.
- The Pareto chart shows that 80% of sales come from “Green” products (A-Items), with the other 15% and 5% coming from “Blue” (B-Items) and “Red” (C-Items) products respectively.
- The Laptop-200 Series, System Unit-150 Series, and Camera-250 Series are the top-performing products. Conversely, the Phone-500 Series is a low-performer in both sales and quantity, requiring immediate attention.
- Products like the Water Bottle-30, Patch Kit-8, and MLA Hat lead in quantity sold but tank in sales, suggesting they may be low-price items or were used in promotional campaigns. They could benefit from optimization, such as a small price increase or cost reduction.

## Future Use
This dashboard serves as a vital tool for the business to analyze product trends and track KPIs. It can provide valuable insights to inform future strategies for marketing campaigns, inventory management, product pricing, and overall business planning.
