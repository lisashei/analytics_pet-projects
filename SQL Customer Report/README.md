## Results Interpretation
The report provides essential customer information to help the company analyze purchasing behavior. It identifies highly valuable (VIP) customers, new customers, and regular customers, along with their purchasing patterns. These insights can help the company adapt strategies for each segment, such as implementing a reward system for VIPs or creating targeted incentives for regular and new customers. Additionally, segmenting customers into age groups can improve targeting strategies. The report also calculates key metrics to measure customer engagement and loyalty.

## Future Use
This report can be used to create visualizations in tools like Power BI or Tableau. It can also serve as a foundation for further segment analysis and predictive modeling, such as customer churn prediction.
