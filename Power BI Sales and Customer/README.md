## Results Interpretation
Several key insights:
- The West and East regions met sales targets, while the South and North fell behind, suggesting adjusted business strategies are needed for the latter regions.
- March and June are consistently the bottom-performing months across all regions.
- Perfume leads in sales for all regions. Jacket is also a consistently high performer in all regions except the North, where it is placed in the middle. Mascara is a top performer in the North region, while it is placed in the mid-tier everywhere else. Running shoes are bottom-performers in the North and West regions, requiring strategy revision.
- Customers who bring the highest sales are younger in the male group compared to the female group (approximately 21-35 age range for males and 30-45 age range for females).
- Clothes and Cosmetics are the most popular product categories among all customers.
- Returning customers consistently avoid the PayPal payment method across all regions.

## Future Use
